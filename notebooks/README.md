### Collaboratory (Google)

Notebooks come with a badge which redirects to the Google Collaboratory, then Colab try to crate a copy in your Google Drive.

Any change in your notebook could be 'committed' to this Github repository directly by using the option ***File>Save a copy in Github...*** and providing the suitable notebooks' path.
